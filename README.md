Level3 Resource [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/level3php/resource.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/level3php/resource)
==============================

Level3 Resource is a library for representing resources in different [hypermedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia) 
formats. A resource in a [HATEOAS API] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) must describe their own capabilities 
and interconnections, this is the third level of [Three Levels of the REST Maturity Model](http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/03/RESTLevels)

### Why Hypermedia?

As you can read on prologue of [Designing Hypermedia APIs](http://www.designinghypermediaapis.com/) book:

>Hypermedia APIs embrace the principles that make the web great: flexibility, standardization, and loose coupling 
to any given service. They take into account the principles of systems design [enumerated by Roy Fielding in his thesis](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm), 
but with a little less sytems theory jargon.

>Hypermedia designs scale better, are more easily changed and promote decoupling and encapsulation, with all the 
benefits those things bring. On the downside, it is not necessarily the most latency-tolerant design, and caches 
can get stale if you're not careful. It may not be as efficient on an individual request level as other designs.

>-- [Steve Klabnik](http://www.steveklabnik.com/)

#### Which Hypermedia specification i should use?

Hypermedia is being defined in this days, just the better APIs implements Hypermedia, currently not exists a de 
facto standard, so you must choose between the differents specifications.

Level3 Resource currenly implements or is planed to implement this specifications:
* [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html): This is the most common and active, has a JSON and a XML version. If you dont need use actions is your better option.
* [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren): Currently being defined. Implements some usefull things like actions, classes, etc. Is a good choice if you want make CRUD
* [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/): This is fully oriented to make a API CRUD oriented. 


Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.4.x

Installation

The recommended way to install Level3 Resource is [through composer](http://getcomposer.org).
You can see [the package information on Packagist.](https://packagist.org/packages/level3/resource)

```JSON
{
    "require": {
        "level3/resource": "dev-master"
    }
}

$resource = new Resource();
$resource->setURI('/foo');
$resource->setData([
    'foo' => 'bar',
    'baz' => 'qux'
]);

$resource->setFormatter(new HAL\JsonFormatter(true));

echo $resource;
```

```js
{
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": "qux",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
